## Download the App

We have not yet released a stable version of the app, our team is working tirelessly to ensure that it will be available to the public very soon. We appreciate your patience, and stay tuned for updates on the official launch!

### Download from Apple Store
Upon release, the app will be available for direct download from the Apple Store. This will provide an easy and accessible way for users to install the app on their macOS devices.

### Open-Source Nature
In line with our commitment to transparency and community involvement, the Openterface Mini-KVM app is open-source. This means that once it is launched, the source code will be available for anyone interested in examining, modifying, or enhancing the app. This open-source approach allows for a transparent review process and encourages continuous improvements from our user community.

### Build Your Own
For those who prefer a more customised experience, there is the option to build the app by themselves. This allows users to tailor the app to their specific needs and preferences, and also contributes to the ongoing development and improvement of the software.
