# Basic Control

## üíª Compatibility

- **Host Software**: Install our [host app](/app) for macOS, Windows, and Linux to control your target devices. Ensure your host system is compatible with the corresponding app version.
- **Target Device Compatibility**: No pre-installation or configuration is required on the target device. As long as the target device supports UI operations with video output (e.g., HDMI, VGA) and has a USB port to receive emulated keyboard and mouse control (HID) signals, it can be used. Supported target platforms include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## üñ± Mouse Control

- **Absolute Mode**: The target's mouse cursor is mapped directly to a specific position on the host's screen via our app. This means that wherever you move the host's mouse within our app, the target's mouse will follow the same movement. Note that there might be a slight delay in the cursor movements. You can choose to hide or display the host's mouse cursor while it is on our app.

- **Relative Mode**: The target's mouse movement is relative to the current position of the host's mouse. This means that moving the host's mouse will shift the target's cursor by a certain distance in the same direction, without a fixed start or end point. You can exit this relative mode using a specific shortcut.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard

When the app is focused, you can type anything directly, and these keystrokes will be passed to the target's computer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è BIOS-Level Access

- **BIOS Access**: Use our app to access the BIOS of your target devices. This allows you to control and configure settings directly from the BIOS.

    - F10: HP
    - Assist button: Sony
    - Option (‚å•) key: Apple (to access the start manager)

## üîä Sound

- **Audio Transmission**: The target computer's audio is transmitted via the HDMI input port of the mini-KVM. When using our app, the sound from the target computer will be played through the host computer, ensuring you hear everything seamlessly.

## üé• Video

- **Video Display**: Our app allows you to view the target computer's screen seamlessly. It supports video resolutions up to 1920x1080 at 30Hz for display within the app. The maximum video input supported is up to 3840x2160 at 30Hz via HDMI. Additionally, with the use of an adapter, it can also accommodate VGA, Micro HDMI, DVI, and other video input sources.

## üîÑ Switchable USB Port

- **Using the USB Port**: Only one computer can utilise the USB port at a time. Toggle the switch to change the port's connection to another computer.

??? note "Remember to eject the flash drive before toggling the switch"
    If the USB port is being used by a flash drive, ensure you eject the flash drive before toggling the switch to transfer the port's use to another computer.

??? warning "Power supply limitation at around 5V2A"
    The USB port provides 5V power to an external USB device but has a limited power supply capacity of approximately 10W. This may not be sufficient to power certain external devices, such as a Jetson Nano running GPU-intensive tasks.

## üîå Plug & Un-Plug

- **Connection Sequence**: Follow the recommended device connection sequence for optimal performance. This helps in maintaining a stable connection and ensuring smooth operation.
