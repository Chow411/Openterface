Here are more updates:

## Fulfillment Preparations: Quality Check and Packing

Before we packed up our products, we had been working very hard to test all units‚Äî‚Äîeach cable and its signal transmission stability with our Mini-KVM.

Well I got one bad new and good new!!!

Let's start from the bad news.

### BAD News - Problem: Some Orange Cables May Not Meet the High Demand for Stable Transmits In Complex Conditions.

Since our Openterface Mini-KVM transmits video, audio, mouse/keyboard control data, and USB port applications over a single Type-C cable, ensuring data stability is essential. That's to say, the quality of the Type-C cable connecting the device to the host is crucial to ensuring optimal performance.

To replicate challenging real-world conditions, we created an environment with significant electromagnetic interference to test our cables. For instance, we wrapped the Type-C cable being tested around the motor of an electric fan, with multiple computers running nearby, simulating severe electromagnetic interference to evaluate the cables‚Äô data transmission stability.

*This is a cheap yet effective testing way.*

Wrapping our orange Type-C cable around this operating motor means that it undertakes a strong electric interference (EF593) and some magnetic interference (MF49.9).

Unfortunately, under such condition, some of our orange Type-C cables did not perform as expected and encoutered issues with signal packages loss during the data transfer, raising concerns about potential instability. This issue is particularly concerning for users working in complex environments, such as data centres, or during critical firefighting moments at IT frontline, where reliability is paramount.

In order to investigate further into this matter and understand this matter better, Kevin Peng, our tech director, has built a specific testing program for our team to  test and classify the quality of these orange cables. We will share more information in our commnity about this testing program, and we're planning to open-source this app, so that you can use this app to vertify other cables you want to use with our mini-KVM, or just simply to test your usb cables quality.

*The program is super handy for testing all sort of usb cables.*

Thus, we realised that the orange cable, with its soft, silicone-like texture and attractive appearance, may not be capable of meeting the required high level of electromagnetic interference resistance. That said, it‚Äôs still a great cable for regular data transfer and fast charging, but not for a heavy transmits work in tough conditions!

### GOOD News - Our Solution

After sourcing higher-quality alternatives and testing, we have decided to include the following new Nylon USB 3.2 cables as an additional item in the toolkit version, **free of charge**. We are committed to providing a solution to avoid disappointing you, even if it means further increasing our costs... To avoid delaying shipments further, we have placed an urgent order for the available stock of these new cables from our manufacturer and packed them into our toolkit version.

This urgent order came with three different length of this Nylon Type-C 3.2 cables: ***1M(3.2Ft), 1.5M(4.9Ft) and 2M(6.5Ft)*** in grey color as you can see from blow picture. Therefore, you will recivce an extra Nylon Type-C cable in above random length of above three different options.

For future order for Mini-KVM Toolkit, we will replace the soft orange cable to this new customized Nylon Type-C 3.2 cables in 1.5M(4.9Ft) in below orange color and texture.

So, we hope you would like our decision on this matter and do hope you will use our gadget like a pro hero at your Tech frontlines.

## Shipping Schedule
So, when you will have our Openterface mini-KVM in hands then?
If everything goes smoothly with our shippment, the team of Crowd Supply should receive our prodcuts to their **Mouser's warehouse in mid-December**, then they will do their best to get our Openterface shipped out according to each orders accordingly.

For backers in the US, there may be a small chance to receive our products before Christmas, but this is not guarantee since everything tends to slow down as the holiday gets closer.

For backer in other countries and regions, you would need to wait a bit longer, it could take even more time since Crowd Supply will be shipping from the US, which the pracels time varies from coutries to countries, but **the best guess is to arrive in your door in around mid Janary**.

Fingers crossed that our Openterface products have smooth journey and don‚Äôt get ‚Äúseasick‚Äù, "carsick" or ‚Äújet-lagged‚Äù (laughs)!
