But first, we want to take a moment to say a big thank youto everyone who has been part of our journey this year. Whether you’re a developer who helped us bring our ideas to life, one of our beta testers who gave us invaluable early feedback, a supporter who offered guidance and encouragement, or one of our amazing backers who believed in us from the start—you’ve made this year unforgettable. We couldn’t have done it without you.
