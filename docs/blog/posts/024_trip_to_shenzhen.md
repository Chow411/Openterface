# ✨ 1000% Goal Reached & Our Trip to Shenzhen! 🏭

Hi everyone!

We're absolutely thrilled that we've almost hit an incredible 1000% of our original funding goal! 🎉 A massive thank you to each and every one of you. Your support has been phenomenal! 🧡

We've been busy scouting for the best manufacturers and had the chance to head over to the tech-forward city of Shenzhen today! 🏭 We visited one of the top tech manufacturers there, known for working with big names like Meta, ABB, and Blaupunkt. It was amazing to see their advanced production lines and quality control machinery in action. 🤖 I wish I could show you more photos of their impressive facilities, but for now, I've only got the green light to share one photo with a bit of digital mosaic for confidentiality. 📸

We're feeling positive about this partnership and their readiness to support a tech startup like ours. We’re on track to ensure the manufacturing phase is handled with the same dedication and quality you expect, so we can get our product into your hands soon! 📦🚀

Here's a snapshot of our core team members at the factory entrance. From left to right in the photo: Shawn, Billy, Kevin, Vileer.

Moreover, we are planning to set up a livestream, invited by David Groom from MAKE: Magazine, for next Wednesday, the 29th at 3 PM Eastern. We'll talk about our Openterface mini-KVM and the story behind it. This is a great opportunity to engage with us and ask questions about the product during the livestream! I will post more information later about the Zoom code for joining the livestream on our Reddit community here!

Can't wait to share more updates soon! Looking forward to e-seeing you there on our livestream! 🤟

Cheers,

Billy Wang
