Hello, amazing supporters of the Openterface mini-KVM! ðŸš€

We've been working tirelessly coordinating with manufacturers and various parties, and we now have some fantastic updates to share about our VGA-to-HDMI cable that youâ€™re going to love! ðŸŽ‰

Firstly, weâ€™ve extended the cable length from 0.5m to a more practical 1m, perfect for all your needs without compromising on portability. It still fits beautifully in our toolkit bag and pairs seamlessly with your mini-KVM. (I'll take better photos to show you soon when it works with our mini-KVM in action!)

But wait, thereâ€™s more! The cable has undergone a stylish makeover too â€“ it now sports a sleek, flat design, making it not only good-looking but also more durable.

And hereâ€™s the best part â€“ this upgrade comes at no extra cost to you! Thatâ€™s right, take this as a free upgrade for all our wonderful backers whoâ€™ve already chosen the VGA-to-HDMI cable. Your support means the world to us, and this is our way of saying thank you!!! ðŸ˜Š

<!-- more -->

Excitingly, for our friends in the EU/UK, this cable is now CE compliant, which means you can add it to your order without a hitch! We will also ensure it ships with your mini-KVM after the campaign to EU/UK.

Glad to bring you these enhancements and canâ€™t wait to hear what you think. Keep the feedback coming â€“ itâ€™s what helps us grow and improve!

Stay innovative,

Openterface Team | TechxArtisan Studio
