2. **Network-Free & On-the-Fly Troubleshooting**

Our device establishes a direct HDMI and USB connection between the host computer and the target device, enabling you to take control and diagnose issues quickly, especially in environments where network connectivity is unreliable or unavailable. The hardware startup time is less than 1 second, ensuring you can jump right into troubleshooting without delays or disturbances in your workflow.

4. **Fully Open Source & Community**

    The real magic lies in our commitment to open-source development and community engagement. By embracing these principles, we’re building a vibrant ecosystem where users can collaborate, contribute, and customise the device to meet their unique needs, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. 👨‍💻🤝👩‍💻
