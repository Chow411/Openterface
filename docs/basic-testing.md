# Basic Operation Tests

## Mouse Control

### Absolute Mode
- Movement latency
- Click test (single click, double clicks)
- Drag test
- Accuracy of mouse position mapping

### Relative mode
- Movement latency
- Click test (single click, double clicks)
- Drag test
- Accuracy of mouse position mapping

## Keyboard Testing
- Keyboard mapping test, especially for various special symbols
- Typing test (response time)
- Multi-key press test
- Function key test
- Testing with different country keyboard layouts to ensure consistent pairing

## Sound Testing
- Whether the sound from the target computer can be played normally on the controlling computer

## Video Capture
- Whether the app can display the target computer properly with different resolutions and frequencies

## Plug and Un-Plug Testing
- Recommended device connection sequence
- Disrupting the sequence according to the above recommendations, testing different scenarios to ensure normal operation

### USB Port and Toggle Switch Testing
- **Switching Functionality**: Test the toggle switch to ensure it effectively switches the USB-A 2.0 port between the host and target computer connections without any issues.
- **Port Compatibility**: Verify that the USB-A 2.0 port supports connection with both the host and target computers as intended.

!!! note

    Only one computer can use the port at a time. If the port is being used by a flash drive, make sure to eject the flash drive before toggling the switch to switch the port's use to another computer.


## Different Target Devices
- Testing different target devices, such as different versions of macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, etc.

## Different Host Computers
- Testing our currently released internal test software, such as supported versions for macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Testing whether different OS versions can use the corresponding host app





### Additional Tests
- **Latency Testing**: Measure latency for both mouse and keyboard inputs to ensure smooth and responsive control.
- **Toggle Switch Testing**: Test the toggle switch under various scenarios to ensure it operates reliably and effectively switches between host and target computer connections.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Test the mini-KVM with a variety of host and target devices to ensure compatibility across different platforms and configurations.
- **Firmware Update Testing**: Ensure the firmware update process works smoothly and reliably, allowing for future enhancements and bug fixes.
- **User Interface Testing**: Verify that the user interface of the host applications (Openterface_MacOS, Openterface_QT, Openterface_Android, Openterface_WebExtension) is intuitive and user-friendly, providing easy access to essential features and settings.
- **Error Handling Testing**: Test error handling mechanisms to ensure graceful recovery from unexpected situations, such as connection disruptions or device malfunctions.
- **Security Testing**: Verify that the mini-KVM device and associated software applications implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Documentation Review**: Review user manuals and documentation to ensure they are comprehensive, accurate, and easy to understand, providing clear instructions for setup, operation, and troubleshooting.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the performance of the mini-KVM device under various workload scenarios to ensure it meets the required performance standards and does not degrade system performance during operation.
- **Stability Testing**: Conduct stress tests and long-duration tests to assess the stability and reliability of the mini-KVM device under continuous use.
- **User Experience Testing**: Gather feedback from beta testers regarding their overall experience with the mini-KVM device, including ease of use, functionality, and any suggestions for improvement.
- **Regulatory Compliance Testing**: Ensure that the mini-KVM device complies with relevant regulatory standards and certifications, such as FCC, CE, and RoHS, to ensure legal compliance and market acceptance.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Evaluate the accessibility features of the mini-KVM device and associated software applications to ensure they are usable by individuals with disabilities, including those with visual or motor impairments.
