## KVM-over-USB Basics

### 1.1. What is KVM-over-USB? {: #what-is-kvm-over-usb }
A **USB KVM**‚Äîoften referred to as **KVM-over-USB**‚Äîis a keyboard, video, and mouse control solution that connects directly to a headless or unattended computer via USB and typically an HDMI (or similar, such as VGA or Micro HDMI) video interface. Its plug-and-play design eliminates the need for complex network configurations, making it ideal for IT professionals, system builders, and enthusiasts who need reliable, portable, and immediate access‚Äîeven where network connectivity is limited or unavailable.

### 1.2. How does USB KVM work? {: #how-usb-kvm-works }
![USB KVM Connection Dark](/images/usbkvm/usb-kvm-connect-dark.svg#only-dark)
![USB KVM Connection Light](/images/usbkvm/usb-kvm-connect-light.svg#only-light)

1. **Screen Streaming**  
   It captures the target device's display (via HDMI) and shows it in an application window on your host computer.

2. **Mouse & Cursor Control**  
   Moving your mouse into the [host app](/app) window on your host computer instantly translates into mouse movements on the target device, similar to a VNC experience.

3. **Keyboard Input**  
   Keystrokes you type on your host keyboard are sent to the target computer when the app is active.

4. **HID Signal Conversion**  
   All keyboard and mouse inputs are converted into standard HID signals recognizable by the target device, ensuring seamless compatibility.

5. **Synchronization**  
   The app keeps the target computer's display and controls perfectly in sync with your host, allowing you to interact with both systems on a single screen.

### 1.3. What are the benefits of USB KVM? {: #why-usb-kvm }

USB KVMs are designed for:

- **Simple & Fast Setup**: Connect USB and HDMI cables‚Äîno extra drivers or network needed.
- **Network Independence**: Works flawlessly without LAN or internet, avoiding network instability.
- **Stable Control**: Offers consistent, high-quality (Full HD or 4K) video with low latency.
- **Emulated Keyboard & Mouse**: Uses standard HID signals, ensuring broad OS compatibility.
- **BIOS-Level Access**: Lets you adjust firmware or startup settings right from power-on.
- **Simplicity & Portability**: Compact, low-power design that's easy to carry.
- **Direct File Transfer**: Quickly share files via a switchable USB-A port.
- **[Use Cases](/use-cases)**: Perfect for headless systems, onsite troubleshooting, and BIOS/OS-level fixes.

Compared to network-dependent solutions, USB KVMs allow IT professionals and tech enthusiasts to rapidly configure and troubleshoot devices in scenarios where reliability and offline accessibility are crucial.

### 1.4. Why choose USB KVM over IP KVM? {: #usb-vs-ip }
It's important to understand that KVM-over-USB and KVM-over-IP serve different purposes and use cases, each with its own strengths:

**KVM-over-USB (like Openterface products)**

- **Mobility-Focused**: Designed for technicians who move between different systems
- **Quick Access**: True plug-and-play functionality without network setup
- **Troubleshooting-Oriented**: Perfect for quick configurations or repairs where you connect, fix, and move on
- **Direct Connection**: Lower latency through USB interface
- **Network-Free**: Ideal for secure environments or when network infrastructure is unavailable
- **Cost-Effective**: Generally more affordable due to simpler hardware requirements

**KVM-over-IP (like PiKVM)**

- **Stationary Setup**: Designed for permanent installation
- **Remote Access**: Allows control from anywhere with network connectivity
- **Long-term Monitoring**: Better suited for continuous system observation
- **Infrastructure-Dependent**: Requires stable network configuration
- **Multiple User Access**: Can support multiple operators accessing the same target

**Choose KVM-over-USB when:**

- You need to quickly troubleshoot multiple systems
- Network setup is unavailable or restricted
- Portability is crucial
- Direct, low-latency control is required

**Choose KVM-over-IP when:**

- You need permanent remote access
- Multiple users need to access the same system
- The target system requires constant monitoring
- Network infrastructure is stable and secure

**Bottom Line**:  

- **USB KVM** (e.g., [Openterface Mini-KVM](/)): Excels in portability, straightforward setup, and direct cable-based file transfers‚Äîgreat for local, single-target control.  
- **IP KVM** (KVM-over-IP, e.g., [PiKVM](https://pikvm.org/)): Offers remote BIOS-level access, particularly useful when stable networking is available and truly off-site management is required.  
- **KVM Switch**: Suited for multi-device control in a single physical location but generally bulkier and more complex than a USB KVM.  
- **Software KVM / VNC**: Network-based and OS-dependent, providing flexible remote access but relying heavily on software installation and network quality.
