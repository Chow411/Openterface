### Switchable USB Port and File Transfer

#### Can the Mini-KVM support file transfers? {: #file-transfer }

Yes, the Openterface Mini-KVM includes [a switchable USB-A port](/product/minikvm/usb-switch) shared between the host and target devices.

#### Can the switchable USB-A port be toggled in software? {: #usb-port-toggle }

With the hardware upgrade to v1.9, yes! It supports both physical flipping and toggling at the software level.

#### Why USB 2.0 instead of USB 3.0? {: #usb-2-vs-3 }

USB 2.0 is fully capable of handling video capture at 1080p@30Hz, transmitting HID signals (for keyboard and mouse), and managing standard-speed file transfers between the target and host computers. This makes our product a speedy, lightweight, and portable solution, exactly as designed.

Using USB 3.0 would make the PCB design much more complex and significantly increase production costs. Additionally, while USB 3.0 does offer faster file transfers, it also generates more heat, which could shorten the lifespan of the device.

We are considering the application of USB 3.0 for the next version, targeting more professional use scenarios and stationary KVM solutions.

### Technical

#### Is the Mini-KVM open-source? {: #mini-kvm-open-source }

Yes! The Openterface Mini-KVM is fully open-sourced in both [hardware](/how-it-works/#explore-hardware-details) and [software](/quick-start/#install-host-application), certified by [OSHWA](https://certification.oshwa.org/cn000015.html), and supported by [a vibrant community](/community/). If you are interested in [contributing](/contributing/), please contact us at info@openterface.com. Stay tuned!

#### Can I access a device's BIOS settings? {: #bios-access }
Yes, the direct connection of the Openterface Mini-KVM enables access to low-level BIOS or firmware settings.

This feature stands in contrast to software-based KVM solutions or remote control applications like TeamViewer and VNC, which are typically not capable of BIOS-level interactions.

#### Why doesn't the keyboard control work at the BIOS level for some older target computers?
It seems that some old computers' BIOS can't recognize our device's USB hub, which can cause issues with our emulated keyboard and mouse not working properly at the BIOS level. We're keeping an eye on this problem.

We've had a report that on one specific HP computer, the HP Engage Flex Pro, the keyboard doesn't work at the BIOS screen, though it functions normally once the operating system boots up.

If you encounter the same issue, please report it to us via a GitHub issue.

#### How is video/data transmitted? {: #video-data-transmission }
Video data is captured via HDMI and transmitted over USB 2.0 to the host computer for display. The switchable USB 2.0 port allows USB drive or other USB device sharing between the target and the host.

#### How does the Mini-KVM handle power? {: #mini-kvm-power }
The device does not require an external power supply, as it is designed to be powered through its USB Type-C connections from the host, enhancing its portability. In scenarios where the target device is a low-power micro-computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, it could be powered through the host via the Mini-KVM's switchable USB port. However, this is not recommended. The standard method of operation is to have an external power supply to the target device.

#### Can I DIY this device?
Absolutely! We're a bunch of passionate makers who love to DIY, and we are making sure this project is open source in both hardware and software. You can technically build it from scratch. We're even thinking about posting a guide on how to DIY a breadboard version of our product that would also be compatible with our software.

Our community is already experimenting with different hardware versions. Check out our community posts to learn more, share your own DIY experiences, or even join our [USB DIY Contest](https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/usb-kvm-diy-challenge-2024), co-hosted with Crowd Supply!

Curious about how the Openterface Mini-KVM stacks up against other solutions? Check out our detailed [Comparison](/faq/usbkvm/openterface/#comparison-openterface-mini-kvm-vs-other-kvm-solutions) page.

#### Does it work with a PS/2 computer? {: #ps2-compatibility }

No. We are aware that there are still many old headless computers out there that require PS/2 keyboards and mice. As far as we know, there isn't yet an elegant solution for converting USB HID signals to split into PS/2 keyboard and mouse signals. We are still investigating this matter and considering how to support PS/2 in future versions of the Mini-KVM. If you know of any solutions that could elegantly work with our Mini-KVM, please share them with us. Thank you!

#### Can I use multiple Mini-KVMs with one master computer? {: #multiple-mini-kvm }

Yes, you can! Our Mini-KVM can technically handle this, but we're still tweaking the code and running tests. We're focusing on making sure that our software can automatically link up the keyboard and mouse with the right video source when you use more than one Mini-KVM at a time. Also, we're sprucing up the software's UI to make it better for this kind of setup. Stay tuned to our community updates for when we roll out this feature!

#### Can it power on/off the connected computer? {: #power-control }

Not directly — MiniKVM doesn’t have built-in ATX power control. However, it *does* include [extension pins](/product/minikvm/extension-pins/) that open up the possibility for an add-on module to handle ATX power switching.  

While our dev team hasn’t prioritized this hardware expansion yet, it’s definitely on our radar. If you're into hardware development and would like to contribute or prototype an ATX extension, we’d love to hear from you! Join the community and help shape what’s next.


### Video Related

#### What about video latency and resolution? {: #video-latency-resolution }

Our device handles 1080p video output with under 140 milliseconds of latency, making your control experience smooth and seamless. Check out its [specifications](/product/minikvm/specifications/).

#### What are the supported video resolutions of the Openterface Mini-KVM? {: #video-resolution-guide }

The Openterface Mini-KVM supports a wide range of video input resolutions, including up to **4K (4096 x 2160 @ 30Hz)**. However, its **effective capture resolution** — the resolution actually processed and displayed on your host computer — is **1920x1080**. Resolutions above that will be downsampled, which may introduce slight visual blur due to pixel merging.

??? info "Key Definitions"
    - **Input Resolution**: The resolution output by your target computer.
    - **Capture Resolution**: The resolution at which the Mini-KVM captures and transmits video to the host computer.  
    - **Effective Max Capture**: 1920x1080 — for the best clarity and performance.

- 640 x 480 @ 60Hz (Optimized for old CRT monitors resolution with 4:3 aspect ratio)  

???+ tip "Best Practice"
    Set both the target output and the Mini-KVM capture resolution to **1920x1080** for optimal sharpness and minimal latency.

##### What happens with resolutions above 1080p?
If your target computer outputs at a higher resolution than 1080p, the Mini-KVM will **merge multiple pixels** into one for display on the host. This may make the image appear **blurry**.

???+ info "Improving Blurry Image"
    You can improve visual clarity on the host side by **scaling up the display**. While this won’t restore full detail, it smooths the output and enhances visibility.

##### Troubleshooting Glitches
If you're seeing video glitches or no signal after changing resolution or refresh rate:

1. In the host app, **lower the capture resolution** temporarily to **640x480 @ 30Hz**.
2. On the target device, **revert to a supported standard resolution** (like 1080p).
3. Switch back to your desired resolution in the host app once stability returns.

???+ warning "Avoid Non-Standard Settings"
    Non-standard resolutions or refresh rates above **60Hz** may exceed the Mini-KVM’s stable operating limits and cause glitching or instability.

##### Summary Tips

- **Best clarity**: 1920x1080 input + 1920x1080 capture
- **Avoid blur**: Try not to exceed the 1080p capture limit
- **Scaling helps**: Increase display scale on host side if using 4K input
- **Troubleshoot with low resolution**: Use 640x480 @ 30Hz as a fallback

By understanding how input and capture resolutions interact, you can optimize your setup for smooth, high-quality remote control with the Openterface Mini-KVM.

#### Is it suitable for gaming? {: #gaming-compatibility }

The current design is geared toward technical and IT operations — it’s built for reliable device control, configuration, and troubleshooting rather than high-resolution or latency-sensitive gaming.

That said, some of our more playful and curious users have already tested it with lighter games like Minecraft or emulators, and it works just fine for those! So while it’s not designed for AAA gaming, casual or retro-style games are definitely doable.

#### Will future versions support higher-quality displays? {: #future-display-support }

We know a lot of you are looking for top-notch display features. While it's not our main focus right now, based on your feedback, we're considering adding enhanced display capabilities in a professional version of the Openterface Mini-KVM.

#### Why doesn't it stream video over local IP? {: #no-ip-streaming }

The Openterface Mini-KVM is designed for stable, low-latency control via direct HDMI and USB connections. While it's technically possible to stream video over a local network, our current focus is on reliability through wired connections. That said, we are exploring features like VLC or even VNC integration in our host apps for future releases.

#### How about KVM control over the internet? {: #no-internet-control }

As for streaming over the internet, that’s a whole different challenge — it involves hosting remote services, handling security, and rethinking parts of our business model. It’s not off the table, but it’s a big step.

That said, since our Mini-KVM relies on your host computer, you can already pair it with existing remote desktop tools to control your target computer remotely.

We’re always open to ideas — if you have thoughts on how you'd like remote streaming to work, feel free to email us or join the conversation in the community!

#### Can it work with VGA, DVI, DisplayPort, etc.? {: #video-output-support }

Sort of. The Openterface Mini-KVM captures video through an HDMI port. However, you can use various video adapters like [VGA-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#streamlined-server-management), [DVI-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#unified-control-for-diverse-devices), [miniHDMI-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#simplified-setup-for-tech-enthusiasts), or DP-to-HDMI, to connect different video sources.

### Troubleshooting

#### Why does it sometimes have issues with USB hubs? {: #usb-hub-issues }

When a USB hub is used on the target side, the Openterface Mini-KVM might become unstable. This is because the Openterface Mini-KVM relies primarily on the target port for power. If the USB hub connected to the target is fully loaded, it may cause a significant voltage drop, leading to instability in the Openterface Mini-KVM due to insufficient power. If you need to use a USB hub on the target side, consider using a powered USB hub with an external power supply to ensure stable operation.

#### What if the app doesn't display the target screen or input is unresponsive? {: #unstable-issues }

If you encounter instability with the Openterface Mini-KVM—such as the app not displaying the target's screen or the inability to control the mouse and keyboard—try disconnecting all the cables. After a brief moment, reconnect the cables and try again. This simple reset often resolves connection issues.

#### How does it integrate with AI? {: #ai-integration }

Our long-term vision is for Openterface Mini-KVM to serve as the physical interface layer between AI agents and real-world computers. Inspired by early projects like [OthersideAI’s self-operating computer](https://github.com/OthersideAI/self-operating-computer), and now further validated by recent breakthroughs like [Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 models](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use), this vision is quickly becoming more tangible.

Mini-KVM acts as the “eyes” and “hands” — capturing real-time video from a target machine and enabling keyboard/mouse input via USB. Combined with a capable host computer running an AI agent, this setup could allow LLMs to observe, interpret, and operate full desktops — even across platforms — without needing any software installed on the target machine.

We’re still in the early stages of this integration, but the possibilities are expanding fast. If you’re experimenting with AI agents and want to explore this space together, we’d love to hear from you!
