#### What if F11 doesn't work on macOS applications? {: #f11-macos-issue }

On macOS, pressing F11 shows the macOS desktop instead of passing the F11 key to the app and the target computer. To fix this, you can unbind F11 from the "Show Desktop" function. Here's how:

1. Go to System Settings.
2. Select Desktop & Dock.
3. Scroll down and click the "Shortcutsâ€¦" button.
4. Find "Show Desktop" and set it to the hyphen (-) at the bottom of the dropdown list.
5. This change will let the F11 key pass through to your application on the target computer.

### Switchable USB Port and File Transfer

#### Can the Mini-KVM support file transfers? {: #file-transfer }

Yes, the Openterface Mini-KVM includes a switchable USB-A port shared between the host and target devices.

??? note "How to share a USB stick/disk between the Host and Target devices?"
    Files can be transferred between the host and target by following these steps:

    1. Mount a USB stick drive on the host when the small black switch is set to the side of the host's Type-C port.
    2. Copy the files onto this mounted drive.
    3. After copying, unmount the drive without physically unplugging it.
    4. Flip the small black switch to the other side. This action switches the USB-A port's connection to the target.
    5. Mount the USB stick on the target device and copy/move files off the drive, completing the transfer process of files from host to target.

    This method can also be used in the opposite direction.

??? note "Remember to eject the flash drive before toggling the switch"
    If the USB port is being used by a flash drive, ensure you eject the flash drive before toggling the switch to transfer the port's use to another computer.

#### Can the switchable USB-A port be toggled in software? {: #usb-port-toggle }

With the hardware upgrade to v1.9, yes! We're currently working on coding this feature into our app. Once it's in place, it will support both physical flipping and toggling at the software level. Check with our dev team on Discord to know more about this progress.

#### Why USB 2.0 instead of USB 3.0? {: #usb-2-vs-3 }

USB 2.0 is fully capable of handling video capture at 1080p@30Hz, transmitting HID signals (for keyboard and mouse), and managing standard-speed file transfers between the target and host computers. This makes our product a speedy, lightweight, and portable solution, exactly as designed.

Using USB 3.0 would make the PCB design much more complex and significantly increase production costs. Additionally, while USB 3.0 does offer faster file transfers, it also generates more heat, which could shorten the lifespan of the device.

We are considering the application of USB 3.0 for the next version, targeting more professional use scenarios and stationary KVM solutions.

### Technical

#### Is the Mini-KVM open-source? {: #mini-kvm-open-source }

Yes! The Openterface Mini-KVM is fully open-sourced in both [hardware](/how-it-works/#explore-hardware-details) and [software](/quick-start/#install-host-application), certified by [OSHWA](https://certification.oshwa.org/cn000015.html), and supported by [a vibrant community](/community/). If you are interested in [contributing](/contributing/), please contact us at info@techxartisan.com. Stay tuned!

#### Can I access a device's BIOS settings? {: #bios-access }
Yes, the direct connection of the Openterface Mini-KVM enables access to low-level BIOS or firmware settings.

This feature stands in contrast to software-based KVM solutions or remote control applications like TeamViewer and VNC, which are typically not capable of BIOS-level interactions.

#### Why doesn't the keyboard control work at the BIOS level for some older target computers?
It seems that some old computers' BIOS can't recognize our device's USB hub, which can cause issues with our emulated keyboard and mouse not working properly at the BIOS level. We're keeping an eye on this problem.

We've had a report that on one specific HP computer, the HP Engage Flex Pro, the keyboard doesn't work at the BIOS screen, though it functions normally once the operating system boots up.

If you encounter the same issue, please report it to us via a GitHub issue.

#### How is video/data transmitted? {: #video-data-transmission }
Video data is captured via HDMI and transmitted over USB 2.0 to the host computer for display. The switchable USB 2.0 port allows USB drive or other USB device sharing between the target and the host.

#### How does the Mini-KVM handle power? {: #mini-kvm-power }
The device does not require an external power supply, as it is designed to be powered through its USB Type-C connections from the host, enhancing its portability. In scenarios where the target device is a low-power micro-computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, it could be powered through the host via the Mini-KVM's switchable USB port. However, this is not recommended. The standard method of operation is to have an external power supply to the target device.

#### Can I DIY this device?
Absolutely! We're a bunch of passionate makers who love to DIY, and we are making sure this project is open source in both hardware and software. You can technically build it from scratch. We're even thinking about posting a guide on how to DIY a breadboard version of our product that would also be compatible with our software.

Our community is already experimenting with different hardware versions. Check out our community posts to learn more, or share your own DIY experiences! It could really enrich our community. Plus, you might find that with a few tweaks to the code, our software could work seamlessly with your creative DIY setup!

### Control Mechanism

#### Will there be a version with wireless or Ethernet connectivity? {: #wireless-version }
Currently, we're not planning to add wireless or Ethernet connectivity to our Openterface products. We're focused on providing fast, stable control over USB directly to your target device, so you don't have to worry about network issues. 

But hey, we're always open to feedback! If you think there's a real need for this feature, or if you're struggling to find a good KVM-over-IP solution, drop us an email: info@techxartisan.com. And remember, if we decide to expand our connectivity options, our [community](/reddit) will be the first to know.

#### How is this different from other KVM solutions? {: #mini-kvm-vs-other-kvms }

Curious about how the Openterface Mini-KVM stacks up against other solutions? Check out our detailed [Comparison](/comparison) page.

#### Does it work with a PS/2 computer? {: #ps2-compatibility }

No. We are aware that there are still many old headless computers out there that require PS/2 keyboards and mice. As far as we know, there isn't yet an elegant solution for converting USB HID signals to split into PS/2 keyboard and mouse signals. We are still investigating this matter and considering how to support PS/2 in future versions of the Mini-KVM. If you know of any solutions that could elegantly work with our Mini-KVM, please share them with us. Thank you!

#### Can I use multiple Mini-KVMs with one master computer? {: #multiple-mini-kvm }

Yes, you can! Our Mini-KVM can technically handle this, but we're still tweaking the code and running tests. We're focusing on making sure that our software can automatically link up the keyboard and mouse with the right video source when you use more than one Mini-KVM at a time. Also, we're sprucing up the software's UI to make it better for this kind of setup. Stay tuned to our community updates for when we roll out this feature!

#### Can it power on/off the connected computer? {: #power-control }

Our device doesn't support ATX (power on/off control for the target computer). We designed it to be portable, quick for troubleshooting, and stable for local control. It's really meant to be used when you're right there with your laptop, managing one or several target computers. We may build a pro version in the future with ATX and more features.

### Video Related

#### What about video latency and resolution? {: #video-latency-resolution }

Our device handles 1080p video with under 140 milliseconds of latency, making your control experience smooth and seamless.

#### Is it suitable for gaming? {: #gaming-compatibility }

The current design focuses on technical and IT operations, providing reliable control for device configuration and troubleshooting rather than high-resolution gaming. While it's great for many tasks, this mini-KVM might not meet the display needs of high-quality gaming.

#### Will future versions support higher-quality displays? {: #future-display-support }

We know a lot of you are looking for top-notch display features. While it's not our main focus right now, based on your feedback, we're considering adding enhanced display capabilities in a professional version of the Openterface Mini-KVM.

#### Why doesn't it stream video over local IP? {: #no-ip-streaming }

The Openterface Mini-KVM has been engineered to ensure reliable and stable performance through wired connections, using HDMI and USB. While it is technically feasible to stream video over a network via our host applications, we are considering adding a VLC, and even VNC feature to our host applications in the future.

#### Can it work with VGA, DVI, DisplayPort, etc.? {: #video-output-support }

Sort of. The Openterface Mini-KVM captures video through an HDMI port. However, you can use various video adapters like [VGA-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#streamlined-server-management), [DVI-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#unified-control-for-diverse-devices), [miniHDMI-to-HDMI](/use-cases/#simplified-setup-for-tech-enthusiasts), or DP-to-HDMI, to connect different video sources.

### Troubleshooting

#### Why does it sometimes have issues with USB hubs? {: #usb-hub-issues }

When a USB hub is used on the target side, the Openterface Mini-KVM might become unstable. This is because the Openterface Mini-KVM relies primarily on the target port for power. If the USB hub connected to the target is fully loaded, it may cause a significant voltage drop, leading to instability in the Openterface Mini-KVM due to insufficient power. If you need to use a USB hub on the target side, consider using a powered USB hub with an external power supply to ensure stable operation.

#### What if the app doesn't display the target screen or input is unresponsive? {: #unstable-issues }

If you encounter instability with the Openterface Mini-KVMâ€”such as the app not displaying the target's screen or the inability to control the mouse and keyboardâ€”try disconnecting all the cables. After a brief moment, reconnect the cables and try again. This simple reset often resolves connection issues.
