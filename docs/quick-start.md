# Quick Start

## Product Overview

Our **Openterface‚Ñ¢ Mini-KVM** allows you to control a nearby headless computer (which we refer to as the **Target**) directly from your own laptop or desktop (referred to as the **Host**), via usb and HDMI connection, without the need for an extra keyboard, mouse, monitor or network.

We‚Äôre starting our official crowdfunding campaign on **Crowd Supply** soon for the Openterface mini-KVM, and we're eager to make it a success. By subscribing to the [pre-launch]((https://www.crowdsupply.com/techxartisan/openterface-mini-kvm)) and being our backer, you'll bring us closer to our goal and, ultimately, to delivering Mini-KVM Openterface to you faster.

## Host Applications

The host computer needs to install our host application to use this device, while the target device requires no pre-installation. 

It is compatible with any target device that has an HDMI output and can receive USB-emulated HID signals. Therefore, the target device can be Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS.

The host application has not yet reached a stable release. The macOS version is nearly complete, while support for Windows and Linux remains in development. We are diligently coding as we speak! üí™üõ†Ô∏èüöÄ

## Open Source

 In line with our belief in community collaboration, we plan to open source our host application. We hope this will inspire like-minded individuals to join us in perfecting Mini-KVM Openterface. üë®‚Äçüíªü§ùüë©‚Äçüíª

## How It Works

* The mini-KVM captures the screen stream from the target computer and displays it on the app on the host computer.
* Users can move the mouse to the app window on the host and start controlling the mouse cursor of the target device, similar to VNC, operating two systems simultaneously on one screen.
* When the app is focused, whatever users type via the keyboard on the host is also transmitted to the target device.
* Keyboard and mouse inputs in the app are converted into Human Interface Device (HID) control signals for the target computer.
* The app synchronizes the target computer‚Äôs screen and cursor with the display of the host computer.
