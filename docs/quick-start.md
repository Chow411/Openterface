# Quick Start

## Product Overview

Our **OpenInterface Mini-KVM** allows you to control a nearby headless computer (which we refer to as the **Target**) directly from your own laptop or desktop (referred to as the **Host**) without the need for an extra keyboard, mouse, or monitor.

The ==host computer needs to install our **host application**== (currently available for macOS, with versions for Windows and Linux under development) to use this device, while the ==target device requires no pre-installation==. It is compatible with any device that has an HDMI output and can receive USB-emulated HID signals. Therefore, the target device can be Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS.

It is designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, offering an efficient and clutter-free solution for managing multiple computers.

## Use Guidelines

* The mini-KVM captures screen streaming from the target computer and display on the app at the host computer;
* User can navigate mouse to the app windows at the host and start controlling the mouse cursor of the target device, just like VNC.
* When the app is focused, whatever user type via keyboard at the host also convert to the target device. 
* Keyboard and mouse inputs in the app are converted into Human Interface Device (HID) control signals for the target computer;
* The app aligns the target computerâ€™s screen and cursor with the host computer's display.

## Advantages
* **Plug-and-Play**: Enables immediate use without the need for software installations or configurations on the target computer.
* **Stable & Fast Control**: Rapid Control of the target through HDMI and emulated keyboard/mouse USB connections, eliminating the need for network dependency.
