      <details class="faq">
         <summary>What is the Openterface mini-KVM?</summary>
         The Openterface Mini-KVM is a portable device that allows control over another computer through [USB and HDMI connection](/quick-start/#connection). This KVM-over-USB solution captures video via HDMI and simulates a keyboard and mouse input. It enables to use your own laptop to display and control the target device directly. This tool is handy for tech enthusiasts and IT professionals for configuring or troubleshooting headless devices without the need for extra monitor, keyboard and mouse, especially in cases where the network connection is unreliable or not available at all.

         <summary>What are use cases for this mini-KVM?</summary>
         Please check out this page: [Use Cases](/use-cases)
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>What host computers are compatible with the Openterface Mini-KVM?</summary>
         To use this mini-KVM, the host computer must install one of these [host applications](/quick-start/#install-host-application) to support MacOS, Windows and Linux. Web-based extension and Android apps are currently under development.
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>What target devices are compatible with the Openterface Mini-KVM?</summary>
         No pre-installation or configuration is required on the target device. As long as the target device supports UI operations with video output (HDMI, VGA, e.g.) and has a USB port to receive emulated keyboard and mouse control (HID) signals, it can be used. Thus, Supported target device platforms include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>Can the Openterface Mini-KVM support file transfers between the host and target device?</summary>
         <p>Yes, the Openterface Mini-KVM includes a switchable USB-A port shared between the host and target devices. With a USB stick/disk plugged into this port, files can be transferred between host and target by following these steps:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Mount a USB stick drive on the host when the small black switch is on the side of the host's Type-C port.</li>
            <li>Copy the files onto this mounted drive.</li>
            <li>After copying, unmount the drive without physically unplugging it.</li>
            <li>Flip the small black switch to the other side. This action switches the USB-A port's connection to the target.</li>
            <li>Mount the USB stick on the target device and copy/move files off the drive, completing the transfer process of files from host to target.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>This method can also be used in the opposite direction.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>Can the switchable USB-A port be toggled at the software level? Could this be achieved through a button instead?</summary>
         The current design does not support toggling at the software level; it can only be physically flipped for now. Implementing toggling at the software level would necessitate a new design, incorporating a button and an LED indicator (either green/blue or on/off) to signify whether the USB port is set to the host or target mode. Additionally, this would require the integration of an additional chip, leading to increased costs in both hardware and software development. The existing design represents a compromise, aimed at balancing between cost-efficiency and basic functionality. Despite the potential for increased costs, we are interested in incorporating this feature in a future version for better user experience.

## Technical

???+ faq "Technical"
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>Is the Openterface Mini-KVM open-source?</summary>
         Plans to open-source the project are under consideration. Just bear with us a little longer; We need to tidy quite some things up for opening up. If you are interested into contributing, please do tell us via this [form](https://forms.gle/rwDDsMbs5pFwq7227). Stay tuned!
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>Can I access a device's BIOS/firmware settings?</summary>
         Yes, the direct connection of the Openterface Mini-KVM enables access to low-level BIOS or firmware settings. This feature stands in contrast to software-based KVM solutions or remote control applications like TeamViewer and Zoom, which are typically not able to do BIOS-level interactions.
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>How is video/data transmitted between devices?</summary>
         Video data is captured via HDMI and transmitted over USB 2.0 to the host computer for display. The switchable USB 2.0 port allows basic peripheral sharing. Future versions may offer higher throughput connections with USB 3.
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>How does the Openterface Mini-KVM handle power supply and consumption?</summary>
         The device does not require an external power supply, as it is designed to be powered through its Type-C connections from the host, enhancing its portability. In scenarios where the target device is a low-power micro-computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, it could be powered through the host via the Mini-KVM's switchable USB port. However, this is not recommended. The standard method of operation is to have an external power supply to the target device.

      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>Why doesn't the Openterface Mini-KVM stream video over local IP or wireless video broadcast and support wireless keyboard and mouse control?</summary>
         The design philosophy behind the Openterface Mini-KVM emphasizes stable, wired control to ensure reliability and performance. By prioritizing direct connections through HDMI and USB, we aim to provide a seamless and efficient user experience, free from the potential instabilities and latency associated with wireless communications and network streaming. However, we are open to exploring these features in future versions of our device, as we continue to assess user needs and technological advancements.
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>Does it work with analog video outputs like VGA?</summary>
         Currently it only captures digital video via HDMI. VGA support may be added in the future. Simple analog conversion can be achieved using HDMI-to-VGA adapters.
      </details>
      <details class="faq">
         <summary>Does the Openterface Mini-KVM support VLC for streaming video?</summary>
         No, the Openterface Mini-KVM does not support VLC for streaming video. This is because the device is not designed as a network-based solution, which is typically required for streaming applications like VLC. Our focus is on direct USB connectivity for device control and management, rather than network-dependent functionalities.
