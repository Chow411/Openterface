## Switchable USB Port & File Transfer

### Can the Openterface Mini-KVM support file transfers?
Yes, the Openterface Mini-KVM includes a switchable USB-A port shared between the host and target devices. With a USB stick/disk plugged into this port, files can be transferred between host and target by following these steps:
1. Mount a USB stick drive on the host when the small black switch is on the side of the host's Type-C port.
2. Copy the files onto this mounted drive.
3. After copying, unmount the drive without physically unplugging it.
4. Flip the small black switch to the other side. This action switches the USB-A port's connection to the target.
5. Mount the USB stick on the target device and copy/move files off the drive, completing the transfer process of files from host to target.
This method can also be used in the opposite direction.

### Can the switchable USB-A port be toggled at the software level?
The current design does not support toggling at the software level; it can only be physically flipped for now. Implementing toggling at the software level would necessitate a new design, incorporating a button and an LED indicator (either green/blue or on/off) to signify whether the USB port is set to the host or target mode. Additionally, this would require the integration of an additional chip, leading to increased costs in both hardware and software development. The existing design represents a compromise, aimed at balancing between cost-efficiency and basic functionality. Despite the potential for increased costs, we are interested in incorporating this feature in a future version for better user experience.

## Technical

### Is the Openterface Mini-KVM open-source?
Yes! We will open source both hardware and software. Just bear with us a little longer; We need to tidy quite some things up for opening up. If you are interested in [contributing](/contributing/), please do tell us via this [form](https://forms.gle/rwDDsMbs5pFwq7227). Stay tuned!

### Can I access a device's BIOS/firmware settings?
Yes, the direct connection of the Openterface Mini-KVM enables access to low-level BIOS or firmware settings. This feature stands in contrast to software-based KVM solutions or remote control applications like TeamViewer and Zoom, which are typically not able to do BIOS-level interactions.

### How is video/data transmitted between devices?
Video data is captured via HDMI and transmitted over USB 2.0 to the host computer for display. The switchable USB 2.0 port allows basic peripheral sharing. Future versions may offer higher throughput connections with USB 3.

### How does the Openterface Mini-KVM handle power?
The device does not require an external power supply, as it is designed to be powered through its Type-C connections from the host, enhancing its portability. In scenarios where the target device is a low-power micro-computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, it could be powered through the host via the Mini-KVM's switchable USB port. However, this is not recommended. The standard method of operation is to have an external power supply to the target device.

## Control Mechanism

### Are there plans for a version with wireless or Ethernet connectivity?
Currently, we're not planning to add wireless or Ethernet connectivity to our Openterface products. We‚Äôre focused on providing fast, stable control over USB directly to your target device, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about network issues. But hey, we‚Äôre always open to feedback!
