### **How does the Openterface Mini-KVM work?**

   - The Openterface Mini-KVM functions by connecting a macOS host computer, with the Openterface app installed, to the target device. This connection uses a USB-C to USB-C cable for the Mini-KVM and a combination of HDMI and USB-C to USB-A/USB-C cables for emulating keyboard/mouse HID signals to the target, which is compatible with devices running Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. The system allows you to view and control the target device from your host computer, offering plug-and-play functionality. This setup eliminates the need for a network connection or additional software installations on the target device.

### **What is the expected price point?**

   - Pricing is still being determined and will depend on production costs and demand. We're exploring options like crowdfunding to gauge interest.

## Technical

### **Are there plans for a version with wireless or Ethernet connectivity?**

   - There are no immediate plans for wireless or Ethernet connectivity, as the focus is on stable, direct connections.

### **How is this different from other KVM solutions like traditional KVMs or KVM-over-IP?**

   - The Openterface Mini-KVM is tailored for direct and stable control without relying on a network. It emphasizes user-friendly, plug-and-play functionality, enhanced by an intuitive app. Key distinctions include:

     - No network/software dependency

     - Intuitive app-based control

     - Portability

     - Focus on stable 1-to-1 connections

### **Can the Openterface Mini-KVM be used for remote control like KVM over IP?**

   - The current focus of Openterface Mini-KVM is on direct, local control of devices. It's not primarily designed for remote control scenarios.

### **Will there be support for multi-monitor setups?**

   - The current version supports single-monitor setups. Multi-monitor support is a potential feature for future development.

### **Is the Openterface Mini-KVM open-source?**

   - Plans to open-source the project are under consideration for future stages of development.

### **What about video latency and resolution?**

   - The device is engineered to handle 1080p video with minimal latency, ensuring a seamless control experience.

### **Does it work with analog video outputs like VGA?**

   - Currently it only captures digital video via HDMI. VGA support may be added in the future. Simple analog conversion can be achieved using HDMI-to-VGA adapters.

### **Does it work with PS/2 output to control the target?**

   - Consideration for supporting a built-in PS/2 interfaces is part of our future development plan.


### **Can I connect multiple target devices or use multiple screens?**

   - This version is designed for a 1-to-1 connection to securely control a single target device. Support for multi-device control, multi-input KVMs, and multi-monitor setups is planned for future professional editions.

### **How is video/data transmitted between devices?**

   - Video data is captured via HDMI and transmitted over USB 2.0 to the host computer for display. 
   - The switchable USB 2.0 port allows basic peripheral sharing. Future versions may offer higher throughput connections.

### **Can I access a device's BIOS/firmware settings?**

   - Yes, the direct hardwire connection allows low-level BIOS access, unlike some software KVM solutions.

### **Is there a web application or software required to operate the Openterface Mini-KVM?**

- Currently, a macOS application is being developed for controlling the device. Plans for a web application and software for other platforms are being considered for future development.

### **How does the Openterface Mini-KVM handle power supply and consumption?**

- The device does not require an external power supply, as it is designed to be powered through its USB-C connections from the host, enhancing its portability.
- In scenarios where the target device is a low-power micro-computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, it can be powered through the host via the Mini-KVM's switchable USB port. However, this is not the standard method of operation. Ideally, the target device should have its own external power supply.
